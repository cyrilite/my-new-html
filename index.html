            <p>Most chemistry classes will tell you that water is comprised
                of 2 hydrogen molecules and 1 oxygen molecule, well they are correct.

                (ex. spring and purified). Trace minerals can include things like magnesium, chromium, iodine, copper, and even zinc!</p>
