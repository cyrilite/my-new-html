        <h3>What is the makeup of Water?</h3>
            <p>Most chemistry classes will tell you that water is comprised
                of 2 hydrogen molecules and 1 oxygen molecule, well they are correct.
                In regards to the water we drink daily, there are often trace minerals found within its different forms
                (ex. spring and purified). Trace minerals can include things like magnesium, chromium, iodine, copper, and even zinc!</p>
